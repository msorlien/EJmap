      <prcStep>
        <stepDesc>Data was processed using ejmap_step2.py from the NBEP/EJmap_prep repository (https://github.com/NBEP/EJmap_prep/)

Polygons are from RICTMA_blockgroups_2020_NBEP2023. Polygons that did not contain any land (ALAND = 0) were dropped.

Columns from EPA EJSCREEN and CDC PLACES were copied without modification. 

For NLCD raster data, invalid values (VALUE greater than 100) were dropped. An average raster value was calculated for each block group; this value was divided by 100 in order to normalize the data on a 0-1 scale. To account for large water bodies, the data was multiplied by the percent area land per block group (ALAND/(ALAND+AWATER)). In order to calculate lack of trees (TREES), the average value for tree cover was inverted (1 - VALUE/100).

For First Street data, property risk was averaged at the census tract level. Block groups were assigned the risk level of their accompanying census tract.

Under an intermediate climate change scenario and relative to a 2000 baseline, sea level rise in Rhode Island is estimated to rise 0.39-0.43 feet by 2020 and 1.25-1.28 feet by 2050 (NOAA Sea Level Rise Viewer), marking a difference of 0.82-0.89 ft between 2020 and 2050. To approximate the amount of land covered under an additional 0.85 feet of sea level rise, the area inundated by 1 ft sea level rise and 0 ft sea level rise was calculated for each block group. The area for 1 ft sea level rise was multiplied by 0.85, then the area for 0 ft sea level rise was subtracted from this value. Finally, the area of inundated land was divided by total land area, which provided the percent land inundated per block group. 

State and regional percentiles were calculated using rank(pct=True). State percentiles were defined by the boundaries of each state. Regional percentiles were defined as all block groups that intersect the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program.</stepDesc>

        <stepDesc>EJmap (https://github.com/nbep/ejmap) was used to produce an environmental justice map. Extraneous data was dropped and the following calculations were run: 
    
Indicators that meet or exceed the 80th percentile are assigned a hidden score of 100; those that fail to do so are assigned a hidden score of 0. These hidden scores are used to calculate category scores as follows:

Climate Risk = [1(Flood Risk) + 1(Heat Risk)]/2

Environmental Burden = [0.5(Impervious Surfaces) + 0.5(Ozone) + 0.5(Particulate Matter 2.5) + 1(Traffic Proximity) + 1(Hazardous Waste Proximity) + 1(Wastewater Discharge) + 0.5(Lack of Trees)]/5

Social Vulnerability = [1(Less Than High School Education) + 1(Limited English Speaking) + 1(Low Income) + 1(People of Color)]/4

The following minimum category scores were applied: 80 for environmental burden, 1 for social vulnerability. Block groups that failed to pass at least 1 minimum category score were assigned an environmental justice score of 0. For all other block groups, the environmental justice score was calculated as:

EJ Score = [1(Climate Risk) + 1(Environmental Burden) + 1(Social Vulnerability)] / 3

Block groups with an environmental justice score above 0 are considered to be environmental justice areas and have EJAREA marked "Yes".</stepDesc>
