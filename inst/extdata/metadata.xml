        <srcDesc>PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/places.</srcDesc>

        <srcDesc>These data were created as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's efforts to create an online
mapping viewer depicting potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation's coastal areas. The purpose of the mapping viewer
is to provide coastal managers and scientists with a preliminary look at sea level rise (slr) and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a
screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge
trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at:
https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr

These data depict the potential inundation of coastal areas resulting from current Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) conditions. The process used
to produce the data can be described as a modified bathtub approach that attempts to account for both local/regional tidal variability as
well as hydrological connectivity. The process uses two source datasets to derive the final inundation rasters and polygons and accompanying
low-lying polygons: the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the area and a tidal surface model that represents spatial tidal variability. The
tidal model is created using the NOAA National Geodetic Survey's VDATUM datum transformation software (http://vdatum.noaa.gov) in conjunction
with spatial interpolation/extrapolation methods and represents the MHHW tidal datum in orthometric values (North American Vertical Datum
of 1988).

The model used to produce these data does not account for erosion, subsidence, or any future changes in an area's hydrodynamics. It is simply
a method to derive data in order to visualize the potential scale, not exact location, of inundation from sea level rise.</srcDesc>

        <stepDesc>Data was processed using ejmap_step2.py from the NBEP/EJmap_prep repository (https://github.com/NBEP/EJmap_prep/)

Polygons are from RICTMA_blockgroups_2020_NBEP2023. Polygons that did not contain any land (ALAND = 0) were dropped.

Columns from EPA EJSCREEN and CDC PLACES were copied without modification. 

For NLCD raster data, invalid values (VALUE greater than 100) were dropped. An average raster value was calculated for each block group; this value was divided by 100 in order to normalize the data on a 0-1 scale. To account for large water bodies, the data was multiplied by the percent area land per block group (ALAND/(ALAND+AWATER)). In order to calculate lack of trees (TREES), the average value for tree cover was inverted (1 - VALUE/100).

For First Street data, property risk was averaged at the census tract level. Block groups were assigned the risk level of their accompanying census tract.

Under an intermediate climate change scenario and relative to a 2000 baseline, sea level rise in Rhode Island is estimated to rise 0.39-0.43 feet by 2020 and 1.25-1.28 feet by 2050 (NOAA Sea Level Rise Viewer), marking a difference of 0.82-0.89 ft between 2020 and 2050. To approximate the amount of land covered under an additional 0.85 feet of sea level rise, the area inundated by 1 ft sea level rise and 0 ft sea level rise was calculated for each block group. The area for 1 ft sea level rise was multiplied by 0.85, then the area for 0 ft sea level rise was subtracted from this value. Finally, the area of inundated land was divided by total land area, which provided the percent land inundated per block group. 

State and regional percentiles were calculated using rank(pct=True). State percentiles were defined by the boundaries of each state. Regional percentiles were defined as all block groups that intersect the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program.</stepDesc>
